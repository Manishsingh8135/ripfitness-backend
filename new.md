okay do one thing follow the instructions inside the comprehensive_develeopment file inside .llm and prompts and then quick_reference_guide file and tell me what did you learn


awesome. first go to our instructions inside instructions folder inside .llm. try to learn what is it all about and then make sense of what is it all aobut and where are we at the moment



actually current progress files are not updated. sodon't refere to it. refere to our project files and folder and figure out where are we at the moment. also alanyse the instructions files



okay refer to ur db instruction file in .llm and then refer  to all other files inside instruction folder inside .llm



read architecture files now, conventions, file folder convention and other useful things. rrread about project context


what would you suggest me to do first? create schemas? or setup clerk first?
